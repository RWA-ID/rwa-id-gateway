You are working inside my existing Replit project “rwaid-gatewayzip--nftworldeth”.

GOAL:
Make sure the deployed (published) app runs the gateway code from the /rwaid-gateway folder, and that signatures are produced WITHOUT the Ethereum Signed Message prefix (raw digest signature) so my mainnet wildcard resolver verifies correctly.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- This Replit project currently has TWO index.js files: one at the project root and one inside /rwaid-gateway/index.js.
- The correct gateway server code is inside /rwaid-gateway/index.js.
- The gateway must expose:
  - GET /health -> returns JSON including ok, chainId, rpc, registry, signer
  - GET /resolve?name=label.slug.rwa-id.eth -> returns JSON including messageHash + signature
  - GET /:sender/:data.json -> returns JSON { data: "0x..." } where data is ABI-encoded (bytes32 node, address resolved, bytes32 messageHash, bytes signature)
- Environment variables used:
  - LINEA_RPC_URL
  - RWA_ID_REGISTRY
  - GATEWAY_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY
  - PORT (optional)

TASKS (DO THEM IN THIS ORDER):

1) Ensure the Replit run command executes the folder gateway:
   - Edit the .replit file (or whatever Replit uses for run config) so running the repl does:
     cd rwaid-gateway && npm install && node index.js
   - Do NOT run the root index.js. If needed, ignore it.

2) In /rwaid-gateway/index.js, change all signature generation to RAW digest signing (NO prefix):
   Replace any code that does:
     await signer.signMessage(ethers.getBytes(messageHash))
   with:
     signer.signingKey.sign(messageHash).serialized
   Do this anywhere it appears (likely 2–3 places).

3) Upgrade /health endpoint to include network + signer details:
   - /health must return:
     {
       ok: true,
       chainId: "<string>",
       rpc: "<LINEA_RPC_URL>",
       registry: "<RWA_ID_REGISTRY>",
       signer: "<address derived from GATEWAY_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY>"
     }
   - chainId must come from provider.getNetwork().

4) Verify dependencies for the folder app:
   - Ensure /rwaid-gateway/package.json has dependencies: express, ethers, dotenv
   - If dotenv is missing, add it.
   - Keep it simple; no TypeScript.

5) After changes:
   - Restart the repl.
   - In the console, print startup logs:
     “rwaid-gateway listening on :<PORT>”
     and print LINEA_RPC_URL + RWA_ID_REGISTRY.
   - Then run a quick internal self-check in the console by requesting:
     /health
   Confirm the signer shown matches the private key’s address (expected: 0xC9fACcf3a77b553375017efFEe441D9770fAA723).

6) Publish/Republish the app and give me the final stable URL.

Output format:
- Briefly list exactly what files you changed and what you changed.
- Then show the exact run command configuration you set.
- Then show the /health JSON response after restart.
